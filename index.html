                        <p>Here is my story: I volunteered at Milal, a place where we get to spend time with people with cognitive disabilities. After couple years of volunteering, I got to spend time with Josh and although it was hard to connect at first, after countless attempts I learned that he was very interested in mobile apps. He was mesmerized and enjoyed the flashes on the screen, so while browsing through the app store, I realized that there were not many apps catered to people with cognitive disabilities and most apps were too complicated. So I made it my goal to create apps for minority groups, so that they can enjoy technology as well.</p>
