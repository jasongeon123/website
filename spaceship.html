                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p>With massive amounts of shipping information given to the user like various shipping rates, packages, and companies, there must be a way to compile all this information to be more accessible to the user.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Research Methods</h1>
                    <p>To explore issues with our apps, we conducted several A/B testing to test user's experiences with Spaceship. We chose to test multiple groups of people to see if they were in need of this service and their feedback on it. To get an insight on how different groups of people can use this apps, we were able to test this app to multiple different types of people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#556DC8">How might a user save time and effort in their quest to find the most affordable shipping prices amongst the three major shipping companies?</h4>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
                    <p>We started by storyboarding our problem. We decided that in order to create a solution, we must dive deeply into the problem and came up with situations where our app can be used.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img id="storyboard3" src = "Images/8.png" alt="loading">
                        <img id="storyboard1" src = "Images/6.png" alt="loading">
                        <img id="storyboard2" src = "Images/7.png" alt="loading">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Sketching</h1>
                    <p>In order to come up with a solution, we mapped out how our app was able to create a easier user experience. And based off of our storyboarding, what features were a must in the app. Our main priority was to make the inputting package demensions easier and so that the user has an easier time comparing shipping prices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img id="storyboard4" src = "Images/9.png" alt="loading">
                        <img id="storyboard2" src = "Images/10.png" alt="loading">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Low-Fi Prototype</h1>
                    <p>From our sketches and storyboards we were able to make a prototype in figma. For prototype 1 we focused on the ease of use of adding packages to the calculator. For prototype 2 we focused on how to display package information. Although both had very similar features, we also focused on various designs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img id="storyboard5" src = "Images/2.png" alt="loading">
                    </div>
                    <h1>Low-Fi User Testing</h1>
                    <p>We were able to get a zoom call with some of my classmates and went through the prototypes to determine which flow was easier to navigate and which features could be added or taken out.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Point-of-View</h1>
                    <p>From our feedback, we decided to combine both the prototypes together using the general theme of the first prototype, but using the graph view of the second prototype so that the users can see a better view of the price comparisons.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>High-Fi Prototype</h1>
                    <p>We were able to code the basic functionalities of the app and wire them together using HTML,CSS, JS, and other libraries. We tried to combine both the prototypes together.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img id="storyboard7" src = "Images/3.png" alt="loading">
                    </div>
                    <h1>Final Prototype</h1>
                    <p>Link to the project:</p><a id= "link" href="https://spaceship-astronaut.herokuapp.com/">https://spaceship-astronaut.herokuapp.com/</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p> So what happened at the end? Well to look back at my goals it was to find the easiest methods to shipping? So how did we achieve this. As mentioned before we took the best parts of each website and put them into our website and we were able to print out the correct information for multiple carriers. With our presaving functionalities and preset package sizes that are the most efficient, we are able to save so much time since all the information was all on the same site. Since we took the best parts of each carrier we were also able to compile the information that was very easy for the user to understand.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                        <img id="storyboard7" src = "Images/4.png" alt="loading">
                    </div>
                    <h1>Reflections</h1>
                    <p>We realized that the two most important things were presenting the right information and making sure that the user can easily navigate through the app. And I think we were able to accomplish that task. Biggest problem we face is making sure the user has an easy experience which is hard because you can only fit so many things in the mobile screen, but luckily we were able to bypass such restraints by resizing somethings to make sure that the user had a good experience.</p>
