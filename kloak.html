                    <h1>Current Design</h1>
                    <p>When I was working at Kloak, there was a huge discussion about how we can captivate our audience based on first glance, but it seemed out design was a bit too plain. </p>

                    <h1>New Design</h1>
                    <p>The new design adds more color and vibrance to the astheitic and it was something that we were playing around with while I was there. Alhtough the design iteself was very elementary we were hoping to captivate the audience.</p>
