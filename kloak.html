                    <p>How much do you value your data and photos? Would you want someone to talk about your personal belongings? These big companies where you store your precious information either gets leaked or sold allegedly. Why would you want to save your data at a place where they only see your ID. If data gets leaked they do not tell you, but they only say that your ID number was leaked. There is no way we can get this information back; whoever has it just has it and can do anything they want with it. All this can be mitigated by using a different service. We use encryption to save your data.

                    <h4>Proposed New Design</h4>
                    <p>The new design adds more color and vibrance to the astheitic and it was something that we were playing around with while I was there. Although the design iteself was very elementary we were hoping to captivate the audience.</p>

                    <h3>Current Design</h3>
                    <p>When I was working at Kloak, there was a huge discussion about how we can captivate our audience based on first glance, but it seemed out design was a bit too plain. </p>
                    <br>
                    <img id="past" src = "Images/kloak1.png" alt="loading">
                </div>
                <div class ="left">
                    <br>
                    <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
                    <p>Due to low acquisition of new users. We used the old website and the new website to accurately find out which front webpage caused the most customer acquisition.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Final Prototype</h1>
                    <p>Link to the project:</p><a id= "link" href="https://gokloak.com">https://gokloak.com/</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p> So what did we learn from the feedback? We learned that the front page is better when it is more colorful, but the old payment methods caused more acquisitions, while the front page of the B cause more interest in the company and from the feedback, we realized that the more colorful front page answered what exactly the comapny looked like from the jump.</p>

                    <h1>Solution</h1>
                    <p>It has been really hard to come to a resolution because it is hard to make a huge group of people move, but we have to realize that if we make even one person realize it could lead to a big movement. So although there is no direct resolution we made this app to protect the data and meanwhile try to educate in the process. That was our main goal, and we went with a hybrid build as you can see from the current design. </p>
